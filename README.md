AAF-ascii_animation_framework - a minimalistic ( roughly 400 lines ) framework for ascii animation right in a terminal window written in .. bash.

The way you mod the provided "ascii_animation__project.sh" file is up to you and the way it' handled is actually inspired of "Processing ( P5 )" & consorts to get the end-users up & running quickly !  

The project is currently in a pretty early stage ( humm ... 1,5 days ? ), but I think we 'll be able to have a lot of fun experimenting with it when it gets bigger ... while still keeping it DRY & KISS, & in 'pure Bash'

simplest ( wip ) example possible:

expect more updates soon ( .. ).
