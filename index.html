<a name="welcome-to-the-aaf-github-project-page" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-the-aaf-github-project-page"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to the AAF GitHub Project Page</h3>

<p>This project aims to give end-[power-(?)]users an easy &amp; functional way to experiment with ASCII animations directly from a terminal window.
It provides several functions in "some unified way", simplifying further additions &amp; experiments.</p>

<p>Using the framework is intended to be a lot like "Processing ( P5 )" &amp; others (..) for the users to get their grips on it as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>This doc is quite minimalistic, so if you want to use this project, read it thoroughly :)</p>

<h3>
<a name="notes" class="anchor" href="#notes"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Notes</h3>

<p>Each game / project willing to use the framework must be made of at least three files:</p>

<ul>
<li>the "ascii_animation__executable.sh" file -- the actual executable ( what to run )</li>
<li>the "ascii_animation__project.sh" file -- containing the barebone code &amp; yours</li>
<li>the "ascii_animation__framework.sh" file -- containing the framework itself</li>
</ul><p>In a near future, I am willing to try different "experimental inputs" &amp; add them to the framework, thus providing sort of "event handling" capabilities as an "additional bonus" ;p</p>

<h3>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h3>

<ul>
<li>the "ascii_animation__executable.sh" file:</li>
</ul><p>This file is the actual executable ( the one to run / execute to launch your project ).
You can add any infos you'd like as comments, in the dedicated space if possible or at least preceeded by "##".
The rest of the file needs to stay untouched for the framework to work correctly ( .. ).</p>

<p>ascii_animation__executable.sh - provided / barebone example</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
# the above is not actually necessary for me, except of a cleaner debugging / coding ( .. )

<ul>
<li>the "ascii_animation__project.sh" file:</li>
</ul><p>This file is the one that contains the barebone code for using the framework &amp; your own functions &amp; variables.
It MUST contain at least a "setup()" &amp; a "draw()" function.
More than necessary, these function are the ones you 'll use for initialization &amp; looping.
As their names suggest, the "setup()" function is used for the initializations while the "draw()" function 'll simply enter an infinite loop.
To exit that infinite loop, simply hit "Ctrl-C" &amp; you'll be redirected to your prompt ( nb: some "custom cleanup handlers" 'll be added in a near future ( .. ) ). </p>

# you can define your variables and function in below

# "setup()" function - 'll run once at the beginning of the game / project execution -- ! MUST BE PRESENT ( can be empty )
setup(){

  saveContext # save cursor position before drawing
  echo -en "user text in setup() function ..."
  restoreContext # restore the cursor position after drawing

  sleep 5 # wait a little bit for our user to see the message displayed above ( as we're in the "setup()" function, it's ok to invoke the "sleep()" function -&gt; aka it won't mess with the framerate )

}

# "draw()" function - 'll be called repeatedly in an infinite loop until the user hit "Ctrl-C" -- ! MUST BE PRESENT ( can be empty )
draw(){

  saveContext # save cursor position before drawing
  drawCenteredText "Hello World end-user !" # draw a one-line text, centered
  restoreContext # restore the cursor position after drawing

}

<ul>
<li>the "ascii_animation__framework.sh" file:</li>
</ul><p>This file is the the framework itself.
DON'T MODIFY IT UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING ! ( yup, that's a warning .. ).
In fact, you should never [ever] need to do so.
If you need custom functions ( wich are not already setup system-wide, if you know what i mean -&gt; If you don't, this comment is not for you ), you just have to write them in the "ascii_animation__project.sh" file, right before the declaration of the "setup()" function ( I left a comment there ;) ).
If you really, deeply need more space, and to keep a clean "ascii_animation__project.sh" file, what you can do is "source" the "big file" containing you custom code in the "ascii_animation__project.sh" file, right were you'd have declared some custom variables &amp; functions.</p>

<p>ascii_animation__project.sh - example of "sourcing" an external file containing custom code</p>

<pre><code># ( .. )
# you can define your variables and function in below
# "source" the external file's content
source myexternalfile.sh
# we can also do stuff BEFORE &amp; outside the "setup()" function ( not AFTER it elsewhere )
# that's what we'll do here, as an EXAMPLE ( nb: also, DON'T use "echo" &amp; prefer the framework equivalent )
# display the number held by our variable defined in the external file
displayNumber $aVariable
# echo the text held by another variable defined in our external file
echo -en "$anotherVariable" 

# "setup()" function
# ( .. )
</code></pre>

<p>simple example of an external file that'd be "sourced" by the "ascii_animation__project.sh" file
( it is good practice NOT to use names starting with "aaf" or "AAF" -&gt; the framework 'll use these a "namespaces" in the next update of the project ).</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
# myexternalfile.sh

# declare a variable
aVariable=0
anotherVariable="Hello there .."

# declare a function
displayNumber(){
  echo -en "$1" # echo the first parameter passed
}
</code></pre>
